Actually, I don't remeber someone read to me, so, I don't know. But I became a reader pretty early, when I was five. 
After that I used to read a lot of books and it's pretty hard to choose the particual one.
But, I think my favourite book was Naksitrallid (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D1%83%D1%84%D1%82%D0%B0,_%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%B8_%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%91%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0)
