1. 
The first sentence is super strange for me, like you decided to buy a car before it has broken.
The second sentence shows the usual sequence like after the car has broken I decided to sell it.

2. 
In the first sentence there is an accent on the action in the future is already finished. The second one
means that you just will start to move.

3.
The first one means that you was thinking some period of time about some action and maybe still continue doing it.
The second one means that you spent some time for thinking in the past but now you don't do it.

4.
In the first sentence there is an accent on the result of an action. Like I have used it a lot and now it is broken.
In the second one there is just information about how often you used your hairdryer.

5.
The same like in the previous one. The second sentence shows that you was doing some action and maybe still doing it. 
The first one means you have already finished your thinking process.
