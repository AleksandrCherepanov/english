Hi Simon,
I'm glad to get your email. Isaac is right I'd like to speak with someone who is a native English speker.
Let me introduce myself. I'm Alex and I'm a usual modest Russian guy. I grew up in a small rural city called Polazna.
It's near one million people city - Perm which is amidst Ural mountains. I have full family and yanger sister. 

I had a simple childhood as many my friends. I liked riding bycile and playing outside with friends. 
I used to do swimming a lot but now I don't have a lot time for it. I would help my parents with gardening 
and some house matters. In 2012 I graduated from the Perm's Politechnic Unviersity as a software engineer 
and now I work in an international company Xsolla, Inc as a backend developer.

About meeting, I wonder if you're going to visit one of the south asia's contries on your vocation?
Now I work in Malaysia and it would be incredibly convenient if you were able to come to Thailand or Singapure.
Also, I guess you could find it's really relaxing being on Thailan's beeches or enjoying theme parks of Singapure.
Just think about it and let me know if it's interesting for you. In any case you also can suggest some place.

I'll wait your answer impatiently and it's really amazing you texted me.

Best wishes,
Alex.
