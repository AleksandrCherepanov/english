##### Writing
My favourite piece of song is "The truth beneath the rose" by "Within Temptation".
First of all because it is a genre of music called symphonic metall I like the most.
Secondly, this song combines together perfect music, vocal and, the most important, deep sense of lyrics.
This song is about a crusader who started to lose his faith after all his had done through his life. 
He afraid of his doubts and tries to seek the answer using his usual way - speaking with the Lord. 
In the end he undersand that there is on only black and white colors. 
I think it's fantastic song with really philosophical topic. I recommend listening to in for everyone.
